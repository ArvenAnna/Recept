To start application you need:

1. Clone app
2. Run in terminal from project's root: docker-compose build, then: docker-compose up
3. Go inside postgres container, run :
   psql -Upostgres
   create database recept;
   \c recept
   \i /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/recept_plain.sql
4. Run docker-compose down && docker-compose up
5. To make dump use inside postgres container
    pg_dump -U postgres recept > docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/recept_plain.sql

6. Useful actions with db using psql
    \dt - show tables
    \q - exit
    drop database recipe

What could be done else:
- recipe pagination
- check how tree retrieved in hibernate - too much joins

Features:

- change order of details

- turn description to normal mode when focusout of detail
- when no text on detail add possibility to add
